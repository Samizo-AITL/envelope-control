# 🧭 Envelope Control

This repository studies **control architectures that explicitly treat operational envelopes**
(sensor, actuator, and V–I limits) as **first-class control states**.

## 💡 Concept

Conventional control systems prioritize performance and tracking accuracy.  
**Envelope Control** instead prioritizes **staying within the physically and operationally safe region**
of the controlled system.

In this framework:

- 🔄 Exceeding an operational envelope is treated as a **state transition**, not a disturbance
- 🧠 Finite State Machines (FSM) determine **which control modes are permitted**
- 🔐 Reconfiguration or redesign proposals may be generated externally,  
  but **application is strictly gated by predefined envelope constraints**

👉 See:  
- 📘 **[Envelope Control Concept](docs/00_concept.md)**  
- 📐 **[Operational Envelope Definition](docs/01_envelope.md)**

---

## 🧠 Key Ideas

- 📦 Operational envelopes are **explicit states**, not implicit assumptions
- 🛡 Safety and survivability **override performance optimization**
- 🧩 Degradation is handled by **mode restriction**, not aggressive adaptation
- 🔋 Control systems must continue operating safely  
  even under **partial failures**

👉 See:  
- 🔄 **[FSM Design](docs/02_fsm.md)**  
- 📜 **[Design Rules](docs/04_design_rules.md)**

---

## 🛠 Typical Use Cases

- 🚁 Multirotor drones with sensor or actuator degradation
- 🤖 Safety-critical robotic systems
- 🛰 Long-duration autonomous systems with aging components
- ⚡ Systems operating under strict power (**V–I**) constraints

👉 Example:  
- 🔋 **[V–I Envelope Example](examples/envelope_vi.md)**

## 📐 Scope

This repository focuses on **architectural principles and design patterns**.  
It is **not** tied to a specific control law, optimizer, or AI model.

👉 🚫 Explicitly excluded:

- Real-time learning controllers  
- Autonomous decision-making agents  
- Runtime envelope redefinition  

---

## 📊 Status

This repository represents an **independent research direction**,  
separate from prior **AITL controller studies**.
