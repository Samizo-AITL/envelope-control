# Envelope Control

This repository studies **control architectures that explicitly treat operational envelopes
(sensor, actuator, and V–I limits) as first-class control states**.

## Concept

Conventional control systems prioritize performance and tracking accuracy.
Envelope Control instead prioritizes **staying within the physically and operationally safe region**
of the controlled system.

In this framework:
- Exceeding an operational envelope is treated as a **state transition**, not a disturbance.
- Finite State Machines (FSM) determine **which control modes are permitted**.
- Reconfiguration or redesign proposals may be generated externally,
  but **application is strictly gated by predefined envelope constraints**.

👉 See:  
- **[Envelope Control Concept](docs/00_concept.md)**  
- **[Operational Envelope Definition](docs/01_envelope.md)**

## Key Ideas

- Operational envelopes are explicit states, not implicit assumptions
- Safety and survivability override performance optimization
- Degradation is handled by **mode restriction**, not aggressive adaptation
- Control systems should continue operating safely even with partial failures

👉 See:  
- **[FSM Design](docs/02_fsm.md)**  
- **[Design Rules](docs/04_design_rules.md)**

## Typical Use Cases

- Multirotor drones with sensor or actuator degradation
- Safety-critical robotic systems
- Long-duration autonomous systems with aging components
- Systems operating under strict power (V–I) constraints

👉 Example:  
- **[V–I Envelope Example](examples/envelope_vi.md)**

## Scope

This repository focuses on **architectural principles and design patterns**.
It is not tied to a specific control law, optimizer, or AI model.

👉 Explicitly excluded:  
- Real-time learning controllers  
- Autonomous decision-making agents  
- Envelope redefinition at runtime  

## Status

This repository represents an independent research direction
separate from prior AITL controller studies.

👉 Design notes (non-normative):  
- **[Design Log](notes/design_log.md)**

*Envelope Control emphasizes knowing when not to exceed limits,
rather than how to optimize beyond them.*
