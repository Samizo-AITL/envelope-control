# Design Rules

## Rule 1: Do Not Optimize Under Uncertainty
If envelope validity is unknown, restrict behavior.

## Rule 2: Degradation is a Mode, Not a Failure
Reduced capability is expected and acceptable.

## Rule 3: Refusal is a Control Action
Rejecting commands is a valid and necessary behavior.

## Rule 4: Separate Judgment from Execution
Judgment layers must never execute control loops.

## Rule 5: Stop Early
If safety cannot be reasoned about, stop.

*Good control systems fail gracefully and predictably.*
